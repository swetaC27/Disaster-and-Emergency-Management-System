DISASTER AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT APPLICATION
----------------------------------------------------------

## Project/Problem Statement

During large-scale hazardous events, diverse relief organizations need to collaborate in order to provide relief to the affected area.
Massive amounts of heterogeneous data need to be collected which in-turn is needed to be utilized by these relief organizations. 
Due to the lack of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) solutions, there is a lot of chaos and coordination issues amongst 
these organizations while tracking victimsâ€™ needs and responding to the disaster. 
This results in delayed or ineffective response while providing aid to the affected area.

## Project Overview

The proposed system aims to aim to be a comprehensive solution for information management in relief operations. This
platform provides means to effectively manage massive amounts of data including data about the affected area, about victims
and relief personnel, a repository where relief organizations, relief workers, government agents, and camp managers can match
requests of aid with pledges of support, thus being able to help the inflicted people at the earliest.
